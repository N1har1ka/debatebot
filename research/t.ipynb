In theory,\\nanybody can join the debate about the future of humanity, but it is so hard\\nto maintain a clear vision. Frequently, we don’t even notice that a debate is\\ngoing on, or what the key questions are. Billions of us can hardly afford the\\nluxury of investigating, because we have more pressing things to do: we\\nhave to go to work, take care of the kids, or look after elderly parents.\\nUnfortunately, history gives no discounts. If the future of humanity is\\ndecided in your absence, because you are too busy feeding and clothing\\nyour kids – you and they will not be exempt from the consequences. This is\\nvery unfair; but who said history was fair?\\nAs a historian, I cannot give people food or clothes – but I can try and\\noffer some clarity, thereby helping to level the global playing field. If this\\nempowers even a handful of additional people to join the debate about the\\nfuture of our species, I have done my job.\\nMy first book, Sapiens, surveyed the human past, examining how an\\ninsignificant ape became the ruler of planet Earth.\\nHomo Deus, my second book, explored the long-term future of life,\\ncontemplating how humans might eventually become gods, and what might\\nbe the ultimate destiny of intelligence and consciousness.\\nIn this book I want to zoom in on the here and now. My focus is on\\ncurrent affairs and on the immediate future of human societies. What is\\nhappening right now? What are today’s greatest challenges and choices?\\nWhat should we pay attention to? What should we teach our kids?\\nOf course, 7 billion people have 7 billion agendas, and as already noted,\\nthinking about the big picture is a relatively rare luxury. A single mother\\nstruggling to raise two children in a Mumbai slum is focused on the next\\nmeal; refugees in a boat in the middle of the Mediterranean scan the horizon\\nfor any sign of land; and a dying man in an overcrowded London hospital\\ngathers all his remaining strength to take in one more breath. They all have\\nfar more urgent problems than global warming or the crisis of liberal\\ndemocracy. No book can do justice to all of that, and I don’t have lessons to\\nteach people in such situations. I can only hope to learn from them.'),\n",

I look at the major forces that shape societies\\nall over the world, and that are likely to influence the future of our planet as\\na whole. Climate change may be far beyond the concerns of people in the\\nmidst of a life-and-death emergency, but it might eventually make the\\nMumbai slums uninhabitable, send enormous new waves of refugees across\\nthe Mediterranean, and lead to a worldwide crisis in healthcare.\\nReality is composed of many threads, and this book tries to cover\\ndifferent aspects of our global predicament, without claiming to be\\nexhaustive. Unlike Sapiens and Homo Deus, this book is not intended as a\\nhistorical narrative, but rather as a selection of lessons. These lessons do not\\nconclude with simple answers. They aim to stimulate further thinking, and\\nhelp readers participate in some of the major conversations of our time.\\nThe book was actually written in conversation with the public. Many of\\nthe chapters were composed in response to questions I was asked by\\nreaders, journalists and colleagues. Earlier versions of some segments were\\nalready published in different forms, which gave me the opportunity to\\nreceive feedback and hone my arguments. Some sections focus on\\ntechnology, some on politics, some on religion, and some on art. Certain\\nchapters celebrate human wisdom, others highlight the crucial role of\\nhuman stupidity. But the overarching question remains the same: what is\\nhappening in the world today, and what is the deep meaning of events?\\nWhat does the rise of Donald Trump signify? What can we do about the\\nepidemic of fake news? Why is liberal democracy in crisis? Is God back? Is\\na new world war coming? Which civilisation dominates the world – the\\nWest, China, Islam? Should Europe keep its doors open to immigrants? Can\\nnationalism solve the problems of inequality and climate change? What\\nshould we do about terrorism?\\nThough this book takes a global perspective, I do not neglect the personal\\nlevel. On the contrary, I want to emphasise the connections between the\\ngreat revolutions of our era and the internal lives of individuals. For\\nexample, terrorism is both a global political problem and an internal\\npsychological mechanism. Terrorism works by pressing the fear button deep\\nin our minds and hijacking the private imagination of millions of\\nindividuals. Similarly, the crisis of liberal democracy is played out not just\\nin parliaments and polling stations, but also in neurons and synapses. It is a\\ncliché to note that the personal is the political.

Accordingly, this book offers observations\\nabout the conduct of individuals as well as entire societies.\\nA global world puts unprecedented pressure on our personal conduct and\\nmorality.

Our daily routines\\ninfluence the lives of people and animals halfway across the world, and\\nsome personal gestures can unexpectedly set the entire world ablaze, as\\nhappened with the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi in Tunisia, which\\nignited the Arab Spring, and with the women who shared their stories of\\nsexual harassment and sparked the #MeToo movement.\\nThis global dimension of our personal lives means that it is more\\nimportant than ever to uncover our religious and political biases, our racial\\nand gender privileges, and our unwitting complicity in institutional\\noppression. But is that a realistic enterprise? How can I find a firm ethical\\nground in a world that extends far beyond my horizons, that spins\\ncompletely out of human control, and that holds all gods and ideologies\\nsuspect?\\nThe book begins by surveying the current political and technological\\npredicament. At the close of the twentieth century it appeared that the great\\nideological battles between fascism, communism and liberalism resulted in\\nthe overwhelming victory of liberalism. Democratic politics, human rights\\nand free-market capitalism seemed destined to conquer the entire world.\\nBut as usual, history took an unexpected turn, and after fascism and\\ncommunism collapsed, now liberalism is in a jam. So where are we\\nheading?\\nThis question is particularly poignant, because liberalism is losing\\ncredibility exactly when the twin revolutions in information technology and\\nbiotechnology confront us with the biggest challenges our species has ever\\nencountered. The merger of infotech and biotech might soon push billions\\nof humans out of the job market and undermine both liberty and equality.\\nBig Data algorithms might create digital dictatorships in which all power is\\nconcentrated in the hands of a tiny elite while most people suffer not from\\nexploitation, but from something far worse – irrelevance.\\nI discussed the merger of infotech and biotech at length in my previous\\nbook Homo Deus.

My interest here is less in the eventual creation of inorganic life, and\\nmore in the threat to the welfare state and to particular institutions such as\\nthe European Union.\\nThe book does not attempt to cover all the impacts of the new\\ntechnologies. In particular, though technology holds many wonderful\\npromises, my intention here is to highlight mainly the threats and dangers.\\nSince the corporations and entrepreneurs who lead the technological\\nrevolution naturally tend to sing the praises of their creations, it falls to\\nsociologists, philosophers and historians like myself to sound the alarm and\\nexplain all the ways things can go terribly wrong.\\nAfter sketching the challenges we face, in the second part of the book we\\nexamine a wide range of potential responses.

This part investigates\\nwhat can be done about the menace of terrorism, about the danger of global\\nwar, and about the biases and hatreds that spark such conflicts.\\nThe fourth part engages with the notion of post-truth, and asks to what\\nextent we can still understand global developments and distinguish\\nwrongdoing from justice.

Perhaps most importantly, artificial intelligence and\\nbiotechnology are giving humanity the power to reshape and re-engineer\\nlife. Very soon somebody will have to decide how to use this power – based\\non some implicit or explicit story about the meaning of life.

The invisible hand of the market will force upon you its\\nown blind reply. Unless you are happy to entrust the future of life to the\\nmercy of quarterly revenue reports, you need a clear idea what life is all\\nabout.\\nIn the final chapter I indulge in a few personal remarks, talking as one\\nSapiens to another, just before the curtain goes down on our species and a\\ncompletely different drama begins.\\nBefore embarking on this intellectual journey, I would like to highlight\\none crucial point. Much of the book discusses the shortcomings of the\\nliberal world view and of the democratic system. I do so not because I\\nbelieve liberal democracy is uniquely problematic, but rather because I\\nthink it is the most successful and most versatile political model humans\\nhave so far developed for dealing with the challenges of the modern world.\\nWhile it may not be appropriate for every society in every stage of\\ndevelopment, it has proved its worth in more societies and in more\\nsituations than any of the alternatives. Therefore, when examining the new\\nchallenges that lie ahead of us, it is necessary to understand the limitations\\nof liberal democracy, and to explore how we can adapt and improve its\\ncurrent institutions.\\nUnfortunately, in the present political climate any critical thinking about\\nliberalism and democracy might be hijacked by autocrats and various\\nilliberal movements, whose sole interest is to discredit liberal democracy\\nrather than to engage in an open discussion about the future of humanity.\\nWhile they are more than happy to debate the problems of liberal\\ndemocracy, they have almost no tolerance of any criticism directed at them.'),\n",

Members of Israel’s ruling coalition government talk\\nopenly about their hope of expanding modern Israel’s borders to match\\nmore closely those of biblical Israel, of reinstating biblical law, and even of\\nrebuilding the ancient Temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem in place of the Al-\\nAqsa mosque.10\\nLiberal elites look in horror at these developments, and hope that\\nhumanity will return to the liberal path in time to avert disaster. In his final\\nspeech to the United Nations in September 2016, President Obama warned\\nhis listeners against retreating ‘into a world sharply divided, and ultimately\\nin conflict, along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion’.\\nInstead, he said, ‘the principles of open markets and accountable\\ngovernance, of democracy and human rights and international law …\\nremain the firmest foundation for human progress in this century’.11\\nObama has rightly pointed out that despite the numerous shortcomings of\\nthe liberal package, it has a much better record than any of its alternatives.\\nMost humans never enjoyed greater peace or prosperity than they did under\\nthe aegis of the liberal order of the early twenty-first century.

Many of the social and political disruptions of our time\\ncan be traced back to this malaise.5\\nZuckerberg’s vision of reconnecting humans to one another is therefore a\\ntimely one.

The Japanese modernised at a breathtaking\\npace while simultaneously developing a fanatical loyalty to their state. The\\nbest-known symbol of the success of State Shinto is the fact that Japan was\\nthe first power to develop and use precision-guided missiles. Decades\\nbefore the USA fielded the smart bomb, and at a time when Nazi Germany\\nwas just beginning to deploy dumb V-2 rockets, Japan sank dozens of allied\\nships with precision-guided missiles. We know these missiles as the\\nkamikaze. Whereas in present-day precision-guided munitions the guidance\\nis provided by computers, the kamikaze were ordinary airplanes loaded\\nwith explosives and guided by human pilots willing to go on one-way\\nmissions. This willingness was the product of the death-defying spirit of\\nsacrifice cultivated by State Shinto. The kamikaze thus relied on combining\\nstate-of-the-art technology with state-of-the-art religious indoctrination.5\\nKnowingly or not, numerous governments today follow the Japanese\\nexample. They adopt the universal tools and structures of modernity while\\nrelying on traditional religions to preserve a unique national identity. The\\nrole of State Shinto in Japan is fulfilled to a lesser or greater degree by\\nOrthodox Christianity in Russia, Catholicism in Poland, Shiite Islam in\\nIran, Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia, and Judaism in Israel. No matter how\\narchaic a religion might look, with a bit of imagination and reinterpretation\\nit can almost always be married to the latest technological gadgets and the\\nmost sophisticated modern institutions.\\nIn some cases states might create a completely new religion to bolster\\ntheir unique identity. The most extreme example can be seen today in\\nJapan’s former colony of North Korea. The North Korean regime\\nindoctrinates its subjects with a fanatical state religion called Juche. This is\\na mix of Marxism–Leninism, some ancient Korean traditions, a racist belief\\nin the unique purity of the Korean race, and the deification of Kim Il-sung’s\\nfamily line. Though nobody claims that the Kims are descendants of a sun\\ngoddess, they are worshipped with more fervour than almost any god in\\nhistory. Perhaps mindful of how the Japanese Empire was eventually\\ndefeated, North Korean Juche for a long time also insisted on adding\\nnuclear weapons to the mix, depicting their development as a sacred duty\\nworthy of supreme sacrifices.6'),\n",

Secularism is sometimes defined as the\\nnegation of religion, and secular people are therefore characterised by what\\nthey don’t believe and do. According to this definition, secular people do\\nnot believe in any gods or angels, do not go to churches and temples, and do\\nnot perform rites and rituals. As such, the secular world appears to be\\nhollow, nihilistic and amoral – an empty box waiting to be filled with\\nsomething.\\nFew people would adopt such a negative identity. Self-professing\\nsecularists view secularism in a very different way. For them, secularism is\\na very positive and active world view, which is defined by a coherent code\\nof values rather than by opposition to this or that religion. Indeed, many of\\nthe secular values are shared by various religious traditions. Unlike some\\nsects that insist they have a monopoly over all wisdom and goodness, one\\nof the chief characteristics of secular people is that they claim no such\\nmonopoly. They don’t think that morality and wisdom came down from\\nheaven in one particular place and time. Rather, morality and wisdom are\\nthe natural legacy of all humans. So it is only to be expected that at least\\nsome values would pop up in human societies all over the world, and would\\nbe common to Muslims, Christians, Hindus and atheists.\\nReligious leaders often present their followers with a stark either/or\\nchoice – either you are Muslim, or you are not. And if you are Muslim, you\\nshould reject all other doctrines. In contrast, secular people are comfortable\\nwith multiple hybrid identities. As far as secularism is concerned, you can\\ngo on calling yourself a Muslim and continuing to pray to Allah, eat halal\\nfood and make the haj to Mecca – yet also be a good member of secular'),\n",

This ethical code –\\nwhich is indeed accepted by millions of Muslims, Christians and Hindus as\\nwell as by atheists – enshrines the values of truth, compassion, equality,\\nfreedom, courage and responsibility.

Just as Christian societies and Christian institutions often\\ndeviate from the Christian ideal, so too secular societies and institutions\\noften fall far short of the secular ideal. Medieval France was a self-\\nproclaimed Christian kingdom, but it dabbled in all kinds of not-very-\\nChristian activities (just ask the downtrodden peasantry). Modern France is\\na self-proclaimed secular state, but from the days of Robespierre onwards it\\ntook some troubling liberties with the very definition of liberty (just ask\\nwomen).

The most important secular commitment is\\nto the truth, which is based on observation and evidence rather than on\\nmere faith. Seculars strive not to confuse truth with belief.

Instead, secular people\\nsanctify the truth wherever it may reveal itself – in ancient fossilised bones,\\nin images of far-off galaxies, in tables of statistical data, or in the writings\\nof various human traditions.

Secular\\nethics relies not on obeying the edicts of this or that god, but rather on a\\ndeep appreciation of suffering. For example, secular people abstain from\\nmurder not because some ancient book forbids it, but because killing\\ninflicts immense suffering on sentient beings. There is something deeply\\ntroubling and dangerous about people who avoid killing just because ‘God\\nsays so’. Such people are motivated by obedience rather than compassion,\\nand what will they do if they come to believe that their god commands them\\nto kill heretics, witches, adulterers or foreigners?\\nOf course, in the absence of absolute divine commandments, secular\\nethics often faces difficult dilemmas. What happens when the same action\\nhurts one person but helps another? Is it ethical to levy high taxes on the\\nrich in order to help the poor? To wage a bloody war in order to remove a\\nbrutal dictator? To allow an unlimited number of refugees into our country?\\nWhen secular people encounter such dilemmas, they do not ask ‘What does\\nGod command?’ Rather, they weigh carefully the feelings of all concerned\\nparties, examine a wide range of observations and possibilities, and search\\nfor a middle path that will cause as little harm as possible.\\nConsider, for example, attitudes to sexuality. How do secular people\\ndecide whether to endorse or oppose rape, homosexuality, bestiality and\\nincest? By examining feelings. Rape is obviously unethical, not because it\\nbreaks some divine commandment, but because it hurts people. In contrast,\\na loving relationship between two men harms no one, so there is no reason\\nto forbid it.\\nWhat then about bestiality? I have participated in numerous private and\\npublic debates about gay marriage, and all too often some wise guy asks ‘If\\nmarriage between two men is OK, why not allow marriage between a man\\nand a goat?’ From a secular perspective the answer is obvious. Healthy\\nrelationships require emotional, intellectual and even spiritual depth. A\\nmarriage lacking such depth will make you frustrated, lonely and\\npsychologically stunted. Whereas two men can certainly satisfy the\\nemotional, intellectual and spiritual needs of one another, a relationship\\nwith a goat cannot. Hence if you see marriage as an institution aimed at\\npromoting human well-being – as secular people do – you would not dream\\nof even raising such a bizarre question. Only people who see marriage as\\nsome kind of miraculous ritual might do so.'),\n",

As noted in earlier\\nchapters, we cannot investigate everything ourselves. But precisely because\\nof that, we need at least to investigate carefully our favourite sources of\\ninformation – be they a newspaper, a website, a TV network or a person. In\\nChapter 20 we will explore in far greater depth how to avoid brainwashing\\nand how to distinguish reality from fiction. Here I would like to offer two\\nsimple rules of thumb.\\nFirst, if you want reliable information – pay good money for it. If you get\\nyour news for free, you might well be the product. Suppose a shady\\nbillionaire offered you the following deal: ‘I will pay you $30 a month, and\\nin exchange, you will allow me to brainwash you for an hour every day,\\ninstalling in your mind whichever political and commercial biases I want.’\\nWould you take the deal? Few sane people would. So the shady billionaire\\noffers a slightly different deal: ‘You will allow me to brainwash you for one\\nhour every day, and in exchange, I will not charge you anything for this\\nservice.’ Now the deal suddenly sounds tempting to hundreds of millions of\\npeople. Don’t follow their example.\\nThe second rule of thumb is that if some issue seems exceptionally\\nimportant to you, make the effort to read the relevant scientific literature.\\nAnd by scientific literature I mean peer-reviewed articles, books published'),\n",

He will reward the righteous with\\neverlasting bliss in paradise, and toss the wicked into the burning pits of\\nhell.\\nThis grand narrative implies that my small but important role in life is to\\nfollow Allah’s commands, spread knowledge of His laws, and ensure\\nobedience to His wishes.

So how to make the story feel real? It’s\\nobvious why humans want to believe the story, but how do they actually\\nbelieve? Already thousands of years ago priests and shamans discovered the\\nanswer: rituals. A ritual is a magical act that makes the abstract concrete and\\nthe fictional real. The essence of ritual is the magical spell ‘Hocus pocus, X\\nis Y!’5\\nHow to make Christ real to his devotees? In the ceremony of Mass, the\\npriest takes a piece of bread and a glass of wine, and proclaims that the\\nbread is Christ’s flesh, the wine is Christ’s blood, and by eating and\\ndrinking them the faithful attain communion with Christ. What could be\\nmore real than actually tasting Christ in your mouth? Traditionally, the\\npriest made these bold proclamations in Latin, the ancient language of\\nreligion, law, and the secrets of life. In front of the amazed eyes of the\\nassembled peasants the priest held high a piece of bread and exclaimed\\n‘Hoc est corpus!’– ‘This is the body!’ – and the bread supposedly became\\nthe flesh of Christ. In the minds of the illiterate peasants, who did not speak\\nLatin, ‘Hoc est corpus!’ got garbled into ‘Hocus pocus!’ and thus was born\\nthe powerful spell that can transform a frog into a prince, and a pumpkin\\ninto a carriage.6\\nA thousand years before the birth of Christianity, the ancient Hindus used\\nthe same trick. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad interprets the ritual\\nsacrifice of a horse as a realisation of the entire story of the cosmos. The\\ntext follows the ‘Hocus pocus, X is Y!’ structure, saying that: ‘The head of\\nthe sacrificial horse is the dawn, its eye the sun, its vital force the air, its\\nopen mouth the fire called Vaisvanara, and the body of the sacrificial horse\\nis the year … its members are the seasons, its joints the months and\\nfortnights, its feet the days and nights, its bones the stars, and its flesh the\\nclouds … its yawning is lightning, its shaking the body is thundering, its\\nmaking water is raining, and its neighing is voice.’7\\nAlmost anything can be turned into a ritual, by giving mundane gestures\\nlike lighting candles, ringing bells or counting beads a deep religious\\nmeaning. The same is true of physical gesticulations, such as bowing the\\nhead, prostrating the whole body, or bringing both palms together. Various'),\n",

Will I be reborn in a new body?’ These questions are based on the\\nassumption that there is an ‘I’ that endures from birth to death, and the\\nquestion is ‘What will happen to this I at death?’ But what is there that\\nendures from birth to death?

Earlier\\nversions of some segments were previously published as essays and articles,\\nwhich gave me the opportunity to receive feedback and hone my arguments.\\nThese earlier versions include the following essays and articles: ‘If We\\nKnow Meat Is Murder, Why Is It So Hard For Us to Change and Become\\nMoral?’, Haaretz, 21 June 2012.\\n‘The Theatre of Terror’, Guardian, 31 January 2015.\\n‘Judaism Is Not a Major Player in the History of Humankind’, Haaretz,\\n31 July 2016.\\n‘Yuval Noah Harari on Big Data, Google and the End of Free Will’,\\nFT.com, 26 August 2016.\\n‘Isis is as much an offshoot of our global civilisation as Google’,\\nGuardian, 9 September 2016.\\n‘Salvation by Algorithm: God, Technology and New 21st Century\\nReligion’, New Statesman, 9 September 2016.\\n‘Does Trump’s Rise Mean Liberalism’s End?’, New Yorker, 7 October\\n2016.\\n‘Yuval Noah Harari Challenges the Future According to Facebook’,\\nFinancial Times, 23 March 2017.\\n‘Humankind: The Post-Truth Species’, Bloomberg.com, 13 April 2017.\\n‘People Have Limited Knowledge.

In theory,\\nanybody can join the debate about the future of humanity, but it is so hard\\nto maintain a clear vision. Frequently, we don’t even notice that a debate is\\ngoing on, or what the key questions are. Billions of us can hardly afford the\\nluxury of investigating, because we have more pressing things to do: we\\nhave to go to work, take care of the kids, or look after elderly parents.\\nUnfortunately, history gives no discounts. If the future of humanity is\\ndecided in your absence, because you are too busy feeding and clothing\\nyour kids – you and they will not be exempt from the consequences. This is\\nvery unfair; but who said history was fair?\\nAs a historian, I cannot give people food or clothes – but I can try and\\noffer some clarity, thereby helping to level the global playing field. If this\\nempowers even a handful of additional people to join the debate about the\\nfuture of our species, I have done my job.\\nMy first book, Sapiens, surveyed the human past, examining how an\\ninsignificant ape became the ruler of planet Earth.\\nHomo Deus, my second book, explored the long-term future of life,\\ncontemplating how humans might eventually become gods, and what might\\nbe the ultimate destiny of intelligence and consciousness.\\nIn this book I want to zoom in on the here and now. My focus is on\\ncurrent affairs and on the immediate future of human societies. What is\\nhappening right now? What are today’s greatest challenges and choices?\\nWhat should we pay attention to? What should we teach our kids?\\nOf course, 7 billion people have 7 billion agendas, and as already noted,\\nthinking about the big picture is a relatively rare luxury. A single mother\\nstruggling to raise two children in a Mumbai slum is focused on the next\\nmeal; refugees in a boat in the middle of the Mediterranean scan the horizon\\nfor any sign of land; and a dying man in an overcrowded London hospital\\ngathers all his remaining strength to take in one more breath. They all have\\nfar more urgent problems than global warming or the crisis of liberal\\ndemocracy. No book can do justice to all of that, and I don’t have lessons to\\nteach people in such situations. I can only hope to learn from them.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'dataa\\\\21 Lessons for the 21st Century by Yuval Noah Harari.pdf'}, page_content='My agenda here is global. I look at the major forces that shape societies\\nall over the world, and that are likely to influence the future of our planet as\\na whole. Climate change may be far beyond the concerns of people in the\\nmidst of a life-and-death emergency, but it might eventually make the\\nMumbai slums uninhabitable, send enormous new waves of refugees across\\nthe Mediterranean, and lead to a worldwide crisis in healthcare.\\nReality is composed of many threads, and this book tries to cover\\ndifferent aspects of our global predicament, without claiming to be\\nexhaustive. Unlike Sapiens and Homo Deus, this book is not intended as a\\nhistorical narrative, but rather as a selection of lessons. These lessons do not\\nconclude with simple answers. They aim to stimulate further thinking, and\\nhelp readers participate in some of the major conversations of our time.\\nThe book was actually written in conversation with the public. Many of\\nthe chapters were composed in response to questions I was asked by\\nreaders, journalists and colleagues. Earlier versions of some segments were\\nalready published in different forms, which gave me the opportunity to\\nreceive feedback and hone my arguments.

Terrorism works by pressing the fear button deep\\nin our minds and hijacking the private imagination of millions of\\nindividuals. Similarly, the crisis of liberal democracy is played out not just\\nin parliaments and polling stations, but also in neurons and synapses. It is a\\ncliché to note that the personal is the political.

When it\\ncame time to explain how Indonesia, Vietnam and all the other free nations\\nshould relate to one another, and how humans should deal with global\\nproblems such as the threat of nuclear war, nationalists invariably turned to\\neither liberal or communist ideas.\\nBut if both liberalism and communism are now discredited, maybe\\nhumans should abandon the very idea of a single global story? After all,\\nweren’t all these global stories – even communism – the product of Western\\nimperialism?

Perhaps even Westerners should take a break from trying\\nto run the world, and focus on their own affairs for a change?\\nThis is arguably what is happening all over the globe, as the vacuum left\\nby the breakdown of liberalism is tentatively filled by nostalgic fantasies\\nabout some local golden past.

Yet several months after Zuckerberg made his vow, and just\\nas this book was going to print, the Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed\\nthat data entrusted to Facebook was harvested by third parties and used to\\nmanipulate elections around the world.

In small\\nquantities it is an essential nutrient for the growth of plants. But in\\nexcessive amounts it becomes toxic. Modern industrial farming is based on\\nartificially fertilising the fields with plenty of phosphorus, but the high-\\nphosphorus run-off from the farms subsequently poisons rivers, lakes and\\noceans, with a devastating impact on marine life. A farmer growing corn in\\nIowa might thus inadvertently kill fish in the Gulf of Mexico.\\nAs a result of such activities, habitats are degraded, animals and plants\\nare becoming extinct, and entire ecosystems such as the Australian Great\\nBarrier Reef and the Amazon rainforest might be destroyed.

If we continue with our present\\ncourse it will cause not just the annihilation of a large percentage of all life\\nforms, but it might also sap the foundations of human civilisation.6\\nMost threatening of all is the prospect of climate change. Humans have\\nbeen around for hundreds of thousands of years, and have survived\\nnumerous ice ages and warm spells. However, agriculture, cities and\\ncomplex societies have existed for no more than 10,000 years.

In 1853 an\\nAmerican fleet forced Japan to open itself to the modern world. In response,\\nthe Japanese state embarked on a rapid and extremely successful process of\\nmodernisation. Within a few decades, it became a powerful bureaucratic\\nstate relying on science, capitalism and the latest military technology to\\ndefeat China and Russia, occupy Taiwan and Korea, and ultimately sink the\\nAmerican fleet at Pearl Harbor and destroy the European empires in the Far\\nEast. Yet Japan did not copy blindly the Western blueprint. It was fiercely\\ndetermined to protect its unique identity, and to ensure that modern\\nJapanese will be loyal to Japan rather than to science, to modernity, or to\\nsome nebulous global community.\\nTo that end, Japan upheld the native religion of Shinto as the cornerstone\\nof Japanese identity. In truth, the Japanese state reinvented Shinto.\\nTraditional Shinto was a hodge-podge of animist beliefs in various deities,\\nspirits and ghosts, and every village and temple had its own favourite spirits\\nand local customs. In the late nineteenth century and early twentieth\\ncentury, the Japanese state created an official version of Shinto, while\\ndiscouraging many local traditions. This ‘State Shinto’ was fused with very\\nmodern ideas of nationality and race, which the Japanese elite picked from\\nthe European imperialists. Any element in Buddhism, Confucianism and the\\nsamurai feudal ethos that could be helpful in cementing loyalty to the state\\nwas added to the mix. To top it all, State Shinto enshrined as its supreme\\nprinciple the worship of the Japanese emperor, who was considered a direct\\ndescendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu, and himself no less than a living\\ngod.4\\nAt first sight, this odd concoction of old and new seemed an extremely\\ninappropriate choice for a state embarking on a crash course of'),\n",

The Japanese modernised at a breathtaking\\npace while simultaneously developing a fanatical loyalty to their state. The\\nbest-known symbol of the success of State Shinto is the fact that Japan was\\nthe first power to develop and use precision-guided missiles. Decades\\nbefore the USA fielded the smart bomb, and at a time when Nazi Germany\\nwas just beginning to deploy dumb V-2 rockets, Japan sank dozens of allied\\nships with precision-guided missiles.

Life scientists, and in particular\\ngeneticists, have produced very strong scientific evidence that the\\nbiological differences between Europeans, Africans, Chinese and Native\\nAmericans are negligible.\\nAt the same time, however, anthropologists, sociologists, historians,\\nbehavioural economists and even brain scientists have accumulated a\\nwealth of data for the existence of significant differences between human\\ncultures. Indeed, if all human cultures were essentially the same, why\\nwould we even need anthropologists and historians? Why invest resources\\nin studying trivial differences? At the very least, we should stop financing\\nall those expensive field excursions to the South Pacific and the Kalahari\\nDesert, and be content with studying people in Oxford or Boston. If cultural\\ndifferences are insignificant, then whatever we discover about Harvard\\nundergraduates should be true of Kalahari hunter-gatherers too.\\nUpon reflection, most people concede the existence of at least some\\nsignificant differences between human cultures, in things ranging from\\nsexual mores to political habits. How then should we treat these\\ndifferences? Cultural relativists argue that difference doesn’t imply\\nhierarchy, and we should never prefer one culture over another. Humans\\nmay think and behave in various ways, but we should celebrate this\\ndiversity, and give equal value to all beliefs and practices. Unfortunately,\\nsuch broad-minded attitudes cannot stand the test of reality. Human\\ndiversity may be great when it comes to cuisine and poetry, but few would\\nsee witch-burning, infanticide or slavery as fascinating human\\nidiosyncrasies that should be protected against the encroachments of global\\ncapitalism and coca-colonialism.\\nOr consider the way different cultures relate to strangers, immigrants and\\nrefugees. Not all cultures are characterised by exactly the same level of\\nacceptance.

Hence if you think that it is good to tolerate strangers\\nand welcome immigrants, shouldn’t you also think that at least in this\\nregard, German culture is superior to Saudi culture, and Californian culture\\nis better than Japanese culture?\\nMoreover, even when two cultural norms are equally valid in theory, in\\nthe practical context of immigration it might still be justified to judge the\\nhost culture as better. Norms and values that are appropriate in one country\\njust don’t work well under different circumstances. Let’s look closely at a\\nconcrete example. In order not to fall prey to well-established prejudices,\\nlet’s imagine two fictional countries: Coldia and Warmland. The two\\ncountries have many cultural differences, among which is their attitude to\\nhuman relations and interpersonal conflict. Coldians are educated from\\ninfancy that if you get into conflict with somebody at school, at work, or\\neven in your family, the best thing is to repress it. You should avoid\\nshouting, expressing rage, or confronting the other person – angry outbursts\\njust make things worse. It’s better to work with your own feelings, while\\nallowing things to cool down. In the meantime, limit your contact with the\\nperson in question, and if contact is unavoidable, be terse but polite, and\\navoid sensitive issues.\\nWarmlanders, by contrast, are educated from infancy to externalise\\nconflicts. If you find yourself in conflict, don’t let it simmer and don’t\\nrepress anything. Use the first opportunity to vent your emotions openly. It\\nis OK to get angry, to shout, and to tell the other person exactly how you\\nfeel. This is the only way to work things through together, in an honest and\\ndirect way. One day of shouting can resolve a conflict that may otherwise\\nfester for years, and though head-on confrontation is never pleasant, you\\nwill all feel much better afterwards.\\nBoth these methods have their pros and cons, and it is hard to say that\\none is always better than the other. What might happen, though, when a\\nWarmlander emigrates to Coldia, and gets a job in a Coldian firm?\\nWhenever a conflict arises with a co-worker, the Warmlander bangs on\\nthe table and yells at the top of his voice, expecting that this will focus'),\n",

He is\\nhot-tempered, creates unnecessary tensions around him, and disturbs our\\ncorporate culture.’ The same fate befalls other Warmlander immigrants to\\nColdia. Most of them remain in junior positions, or fail to find any job at\\nall, because managers presuppose that if they are Warmlanders, they would\\nprobably be hot-tempered and problematic employees. Since the\\nWarmlanders never reach senior positions, it is difficult for them to change\\nthe Coldian corporate culture.\\nMuch the same thing happens to Coldians who emigrate to Warmland. A\\nColdian starting to work in a Warmland firm quickly acquires the reputation\\nof a snob or a cold fish, and makes few if any friends.

Thus when President Trump described Haiti, El Salvador and some\\nparts of Africa as ‘shithole countries’, he was apparently offering the public\\na reflection on the culture of these places rather than on their genetic make-\\nup.2 On another occasion Trump said about Mexican immigrants to the\\nUSA that ‘When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending the best.\\nThey’re sending people that have lots of problems and they’re bringing\\nthose problems.

Hence the theatre of terror generates visceral fears\\nof anarchy, making people feel as if the social order is about to collapse.\\nAfter centuries of bloody struggles we have crawled out of the black hole of\\nviolence, but we sense that the black hole is still there, patiently waiting to\\nswallow us again. A few gruesome atrocities – and we imagine that we are\\nfalling back in.\\nIn order to assuage these fears, the state is driven to respond to the theatre\\nof terror with its own theatre of security. The most efficient answer to\\nterrorism might be good intelligence and clandestine action against the\\nfinancial networks that feed terrorism. But this is not something citizens can\\nwatch on television. The citizens have seen the terrorist drama of the World\\nTrade Center collapsing. The state feels compelled to stage an equally\\nspectacular counter-drama, with even more fire and smoke. So instead of\\nacting quietly and efficiently, the state unleashes a mighty storm, which not\\ninfrequently fulfils the terrorists’ most cherished dreams.\\nHow then should the state deal with terrorism? A successful counter-\\nterrorism struggle should be conducted on three fronts. First, governments\\nshould focus on clandestine actions against the terror networks. Second, the\\nmedia should keep things in perspective and avoid hysteria. The theatre of\\nterror cannot succeed without publicity. Unfortunately, the media all too\\noften provides this publicity for free. It obsessively reports terror attacks\\nand greatly inflates their danger, because reports on terrorism sell\\nnewspapers much better than reports on diabetes or air pollution.\\nThe third front is the imagination of each and every one of us. Terrorists\\nhold our imagination captive, and use it against us. Again and again we\\nrehearse the terrorist attack on the stage of our mind – remembering 9/11 or\\nthe latest suicide bombings. The terrorists kill a hundred people – and cause\\n100 million to imagine that there is a murderer lurking behind every tree. It\\nis the responsibility of every citizen to liberate his or her imagination from\\nthe terrorists, and to remind ourselves of the true dimensions of this threat.\\nIt is our own inner terror that prompts the media to obsess about terrorism,\\nand the government to overreact.'),\n",

Just as Christian societies and Christian institutions often\\ndeviate from the Christian ideal, so too secular societies and institutions\\noften fall far short of the secular ideal. Medieval France was a self-\\nproclaimed Christian kingdom, but it dabbled in all kinds of not-very-\\nChristian activities (just ask the downtrodden peasantry).

It just means that it is not\\neasy to live up to an ideal.\\nThe secular ideal\\nWhat then is the secular ideal? The most important secular commitment is\\nto the truth, which is based on observation and evidence rather than on\\nmere faith. Seculars strive not to confuse truth with belief.

Instead, secular people\\nsanctify the truth wherever it may reveal itself – in ancient fossilised bones,\\nin images of far-off galaxies, in tables of statistical data, or in the writings\\nof various human traditions.

Such people are motivated by obedience rather than compassion,\\nand what will they do if they come to believe that their god commands them\\nto kill heretics, witches, adulterers or foreigners?\\nOf course, in the absence of absolute divine commandments, secular\\nethics often faces difficult dilemmas.

To wage a bloody war in order to remove a\\nbrutal dictator? To allow an unlimited number of refugees into our country?\\nWhen secular people encounter such dilemmas, they do not ask ‘What does\\nGod command?’ Rather, they weigh carefully the feelings of all concerned\\nparties, examine a wide range of observations and possibilities, and search\\nfor a middle path that will cause as little harm as possible.\\nConsider, for example, attitudes to sexuality. How do secular people\\ndecide whether to endorse or oppose rape, homosexuality, bestiality and\\nincest? By examining feelings.

Healthy\\nrelationships require emotional, intellectual and even spiritual depth. A\\nmarriage lacking such depth will make you frustrated, lonely and\\npsychologically stunted. Whereas two men can certainly satisfy the\\nemotional, intellectual and spiritual needs of one another, a relationship\\nwith a goat cannot.

On 29 June 1936 the official newspaper Pravda (the name\\nmeans ‘truth’) carried on its front page a photo of a smiling Joseph Stalin\\nembracing Gelya Markizova, a seven-year-old girl. The image became a\\nStalinist icon, enshrining Stalin as the Father of the Nation and idealising\\nthe ‘Happy Soviet Childhood’.

Well, that’s just\\nanother comforting myth. In practice, the power of human cooperation\\ndepends on a delicate balance between truth and fiction.\\nIf you distort reality too much, it will indeed weaken you by making you\\nact in unrealistic ways. For example, in 1905 an East African medium\\ncalled Kinjikitile Ngwale claimed to be possessed by the snake spirit\\nHongo. The new prophet had a revolutionary message to the people of the\\nGerman colony of East Africa: unite and drive out the Germans.

It too failed, leading to the destruction\\nof Jerusalem and the exile of the Jews.\\nOn the other hand, you cannot organise masses of people effectively\\nwithout relying on some mythology.

Without myths, it would have been impossible to\\norganise not just the failed Maji Maji and Jewish revolts, but also the far\\nmore successful rebellions of the Mahdi and the Maccabees.\\nIn fact, false stories have an intrinsic advantage over the truth when it\\ncomes to uniting people. If you want to gauge group loyalty, requiring\\npeople to believe an absurdity is a far better test than asking them to believe\\nthe truth. If a big chief says ‘the sun rises in the east and sets in the west’,\\nloyalty to the chief is not required in order to applaud him.

Similarly, if all your neighbours believe the same\\noutrageous tale, you can count on them to stand together in times of crisis.\\nIf they are willing to believe only accredited facts, what does that prove?\\nYou might argue that at least in some cases, it is possible to organise\\npeople effectively through consensual agreements rather than through\\nfictions and myths. Thus in the economic sphere, money and corporations\\nbind people together far more effectively than any god or holy book, even\\nthough everyone knows that they are just a human convention. In the case\\nof a holy book, a true believer would say ‘I believe that the book is sacred’\\nwhile in the case of the dollar, a true believer would say only that ‘I believe\\nthat other people believe that the dollar is valuable’. It is obvious that the\\ndollar is just a human creation, yet people all over the world respect it. If so,\\nwhy can’t humans abandon all myths and fictions, and organise themselves\\non the basis of consensual conventions such as the dollar?\\nSuch conventions, however, are not clearly distinct from fiction. The\\ndifference between holy books and money, for example, is far smaller than\\nit may seem at first sight. When most people see a dollar bill, they forget\\nthat it is just a human convention.

They hardly ever remind themselves ‘Actually, this is a\\nworthless piece of paper, but because other people view it as valuable, I can\\nmake use of it.’ If you observe a human brain in an fMRI scanner, you\\nwould see that as someone is presented with a suitcase full of hundred-\\ndollar bills, the parts of the brain that start buzzing with excitement are not\\nthe sceptical parts (‘Other people believe this is valuable’) but rather the\\ngreedy parts (‘Holy shit! I want this!’). Conversely, in the vast majority of\\ncases people begin to sanctify the Bible or the Vedas or the Book of\\nMormon only after long and repeated exposure to other people who view it\\nas sacred. We learn to respect holy books in exactly the same way we learn\\nto respect currency bills.\\nHence in practice there is no strict division between ‘knowing that\\nsomething is just a human convention’ and ‘believing that something is\\ninherently valuable’. In many cases, people are ambiguous or forgetful\\nabout this division. To give another example, if you sit down and have a\\ndeep philosophical discussion about it, almost everybody would agree that\\ncorporations are fictional stories created by human beings.

In\\nChapter 20 we will explore in far greater depth how to avoid brainwashing\\nand how to distinguish reality from fiction. Here I would like to offer two\\nsimple rules of thumb.\\nFirst, if you want reliable information – pay good money for it. If you get\\nyour news for free, you might well be the product. Suppose a shady\\nbillionaire offered you the following deal: ‘I will pay you $30 a month, and\\nin exchange, you will allow me to brainwash you for an hour every day,\\ninstalling in your mind whichever political and commercial biases I want.’\\nWould you take the deal? Few sane people would. So the shady billionaire\\noffers a slightly different deal: ‘You will allow me to brainwash you for one\\nhour every day, and in exchange, I will not charge you anything for this\\nservice.’ Now the deal suddenly sounds tempting to hundreds of millions of\\npeople. Don’t follow their example.\\nThe second rule of thumb is that if some issue seems exceptionally\\nimportant to you, make the effort to read the relevant scientific literature.\\nAnd by scientific literature I mean peer-reviewed articles, books published'),\n",

The mind is not the subject that freely shapes historical actions and\\nbiological realities – the mind is an object that is being shaped by history\\nand biology. Even our most cherished ideals – freedom, love, creativity –\\nare like a stone knife that somebody else shaped in order to kill some\\nmammoth. According to the best scientific theories and the most up-to-date\\ntechnological tools, the mind is never free of manipulation. There is no\\nauthentic self waiting to be liberated from the manipulative shell.\\nHave you any idea how many movies, novels and poems you have\\nconsumed over the years, and how these artefacts have carved and\\nsharpened your idea of love?

In almost all cases, when\\npeople ask about the meaning of life, they expect to be told a story. Homo\\nsapiens is a storytelling animal, that thinks in stories rather than in numbers\\nor graphs, and believes that the universe itself works like a story, replete\\nwith heroes and villains, conflicts and resolutions, climaxes and happy\\nendings. When we look for the meaning of life, we want a story that will\\nexplain what reality is all about and what is my particular role in the cosmic\\ndrama.

It makes no difference what your particular path is,\\nas long as you follow it. A washerwoman who devotedly follows the way of\\nthe washerwoman is far superior to a prince who strays off the way of the\\nprince.

He kills his friends and relatives, leads his\\narmy to victory, and becomes one of the most esteemed and beloved heroes\\nof the Hindu world.\\nThe 1994 Disney epic The Lion King repackaged this ancient story for\\nmodern audiences, with the young lion Simba standing in for Arjuna. When\\nSimba wants to know the meaning of existence, his father – the lion king\\nMufasa – tells him about the great Circle of Life. Mufasa explains that the\\nantelopes eat the grass, the lions eat the antelopes, and when the lions die\\ntheir body decomposes and feeds the grass.

Eventually, on Judgement Day, Allah will pass judgement on the\\nconduct of each and every individual. He will reward the righteous with\\neverlasting bliss in paradise, and toss the wicked into the burning pits of\\nhell.\\nThis grand narrative implies that my small but important role in life is to\\nfollow Allah’s commands, spread knowledge of His laws, and ensure\\nobedience to His wishes.

Already thousands of years ago priests and shamans discovered the\\nanswer: rituals. A ritual is a magical act that makes the abstract concrete and\\nthe fictional real. The essence of ritual is the magical spell ‘Hocus pocus, X\\nis Y!’5\\nHow to make Christ real to his devotees? In the ceremony of Mass, the\\npriest takes a piece of bread and a glass of wine, and proclaims that the\\nbread is Christ’s flesh, the wine is Christ’s blood, and by eating and\\ndrinking them the faithful attain communion with Christ. What could be\\nmore real than actually tasting Christ in your mouth? Traditionally, the\\npriest made these bold proclamations in Latin, the ancient language of\\nreligion, law, and the secrets of life. In front of the amazed eyes of the\\nassembled peasants the priest held high a piece of bread and exclaimed\\n‘Hoc est corpus!’– ‘This is the body!’ – and the bread supposedly became\\nthe flesh of Christ. In the minds of the illiterate peasants, who did not speak\\nLatin, ‘Hoc est corpus!’ got garbled into ‘Hocus pocus!’ and thus was born\\nthe powerful spell that can transform a frog into a prince, and a pumpkin\\ninto a carriage.6\\nA thousand years before the birth of Christianity, the ancient Hindus used\\nthe same trick. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad interprets the ritual\\nsacrifice of a horse as a realisation of the entire story of the cosmos. The\\ntext follows the ‘Hocus pocus, X is Y!’ structure, saying that: ‘The head of\\nthe sacrificial horse is the dawn, its eye the sun, its vital force the air, its\\nopen mouth the fire called Vaisvanara, and the body of the sacrificial horse\\nis the year … its members are the seasons, its joints the months and\\nfortnights, its feet the days and nights, its bones the stars, and its flesh the\\nclouds … its yawning is lightning, its shaking the body is thundering, its\\nmaking water is raining, and its neighing is voice.’7\\nAlmost anything can be turned into a ritual, by giving mundane gestures\\nlike lighting candles, ringing bells or counting beads a deep religious\\nmeaning.

A\\ncrusader knight, Jean de Joinville, later wrote in his memoirs that when the\\nbattle was lost and they decided to surrender, one of his men said that ‘I\\ncannot agree with this decision. What I advise is that we should all let\\nourselves be slain, for thus we shall go to paradise.’ Joinville comments\\ndryly that ‘none of us heeded his advice’.19\\nJoinville does not explain why they refused.

They just need to realise that there is no\\nmeaning, and thus be liberated from the suffering caused by our\\nattachments and our identification with empty phenomena. ‘What should I\\ndo?’ ask people, and the Buddha advises: ‘Do nothing.

If and when\\nyou ever discover what holds life together, the answer to the big question of\\ndeath will also become apparent.\\nPeople say ‘The soul endures from birth to death and thereby holds life\\ntogether’ – but that is just a story. Have you ever observed a soul? You can\\nexplore this at any moment, not just at the moment of death. If you can\\nunderstand what happens to you as one moment ends and another moment\\nbegins – you will also understand what will happen to you at the moment of\\ndeath. If you can really observe yourself for the duration of a single breath –\\nyou will understand it all.\\nThe first thing I learned by observing my breath was that notwithstanding\\nall the books I had read and all the classes I had attended at university, I\\nknew almost nothing about my mind, and I had very little control over it.\\nDespite my best efforts, I couldn’t observe the reality of my breath coming\\nin and out of my nostrils for more than ten seconds before the mind\\nwandered away. For years I lived under the impression that I was the master\\nof my life, and the CEO of my own personal brand. But a few hours of\\nmeditation were enough to show me that I hardly had any control of myself.\\nI was not the CEO – I was barely the gatekeeper. I was asked to stand at the\\ngateway of my body – the nostrils – and just observe whatever comes in or\\ngoes out. Yet after a few moments I lost my focus and abandoned my post.\\nIt was an eye-opening experience.\\nAs the course progressed, students were taught to observe not just their\\nbreath, but sensations throughout their body. Not special sensations of bliss\\nand ecstasy, but rather the most mundane and ordinary sensations: heat,\\npressure, pain and so on. The technique of Vipassana is based on the insight\\nthat the flow of mind is closely interlinked with body sensations. Between\\nme and the world there are always body sensations. I never react to events\\nin the outside world; I always react to the sensations in my own body. When\\nthe sensation is unpleasant, I react with aversion. When the sensation is\\npleasant, I react with cravings for more. Even when we think we react to\\nwhat another person has done, to President Trump’s latest tweet, or to a\\ndistant childhood memory, the truth is we always react to our immediate\\nbodily sensations. If we are outraged that somebody insulted our nation or\\nour god, what makes the insult unbearable is the burning sensations in the'),\n",

Our nation feels\\nnothing, but our body really hurts.\\nYou want to know what anger is? Well, just observe the sensations that\\narise and pass in your body while you are angry. I was twenty-four years\\nold when I went to this retreat, and had experienced anger probably 10,000\\ntimes previously, yet I had never bothered to observe how anger actually\\nfeels. Whenever I had been angry, I focused on the object of my anger –\\nsomething somebody did or said – rather than on the sensory reality of the\\nanger.\\nI think I learned more about myself and about humans in general by\\nobserving my sensations for these ten days than I learned in my whole life\\nup to that point. And to do so I didn’t have to accept any story, theory, or\\nmythology. I just had to observe reality as it is. The most important thing I\\nrealised was that the deepest source of my suffering is in the patterns of my\\nown mind. When I want something and it doesn’t happen, my mind reacts\\nby generating suffering. Suffering is not an objective condition in the\\noutside world. It is a mental reaction generated by my own mind. Learning\\nthis is the first step towards ceasing to generate more suffering.\\nSince that first course in 2000, I began meditating for two hours every\\nday, and each year I take a long meditation retreat of a month or two. It is\\nnot an escape from reality. It is getting in touch with reality. At least for two\\nhours a day I actually observe reality as it is, while for the other twenty-two\\nhours I get overwhelmed by emails and tweets and cute-puppy videos.\\nWithout the focus and clarity provided by this practice, I could not have\\nwritten Sapiens or Homo Deus. At least for me, meditation never came into\\nconflict with scientific research. Rather, it has been another valuable tool in\\nthe scientific toolkit, especially when trying to understand the human mind.\\nDigging from both ends\\nScience finds it hard to decipher the mysteries of the mind largely because\\nwe lack efficient tools. Many people, including many scientists, tend to\\nconfuse the mind with the brain, but they are really very different things.\\nThe brain is a material network of neurons, synapses and biochemicals. The\\nmind is a flow of subjective experiences, such as pain, pleasure, anger and'),\n",

Biologists assume that the brain somehow produces the mind, and that\\nbiochemical reactions in billions of neurons somehow produce experiences\\nsuch as pain and love. However, so far we have absolutely no explanation\\nfor how the mind emerges from the brain. How come when billions of\\nneurons are firing electrical signals in a particular pattern, I feel pain, and\\nwhen the neurons fire in a different pattern, I feel love? We haven’t got a\\nclue. Hence even if the mind indeed emerges from the brain, at least for\\nnow studying the mind is a different undertaking than studying the brain.\\nBrain research is progressing in leaps and bounds thanks to the help of\\nmicroscopes, brain scanners and powerful computers. But we cannot see the\\nmind through a microscope or a brain scanner. These devices enable us to\\ndetect biochemical and electrical activities in the brain, but do not give us\\nany access to the subjective experiences associated with these activities. As\\nof 2018, the only mind I can access directly is my own. If I want to know\\nwhat other sentient beings are experiencing, I can do so only on the basis of\\nsecond-hand reports, which naturally suffer from numerous distortions and\\nlimitations.\\nWe could no doubt collect many second-hand reports from various\\npeople, and use statistics to identify recurring patterns. Such methods have\\nenabled psychologists and brain scientists not only to gain a much better\\nunderstanding of the mind, but also to improve and even save the lives of\\nmillions. However, it is hard to go beyond a certain point using only\\nsecond-hand reports. In science, when you investigate a particular\\nphenomenon, it is best to observe it directly. Anthropologists, for example,\\nmake extensive use of secondary sources, but if you really want to\\nunderstand Samoan culture, sooner or later you will have to pack your bags\\nand visit Samoa.\\nOf course visiting isn’t enough. A blog written by a backpacker travelling\\nthrough Samoa would not be considered a scientific anthropological study,\\nbecause most backpackers lack the necessary tools and training. Their\\nobservations are too random and biased. To become trustworthy\\nanthropologists, we must learn how to observe human cultures in a\\nmethodical and objective manner, free from preconceptions and prejudices.\\nThat’s what you study at the department of anthropology, and that’s what\\nenabled anthropologists to play such a vital role in bridging gaps between\\ndifferent cultures.'),\n",

For the only mind I can directly\\nobserve is my own, and no matter how difficult it is to observe Samoan\\nculture without bias and prejudice, it is even harder to observe my own\\nmind objectively. After more than a century of hard work, anthropologists\\ntoday have at their disposal powerful procedures for objective observation.\\nIn contrast, whereas mind scholars developed many tools for collecting and\\nanalysing second-hand reports, when it comes to observing our own minds\\nwe have barely scratched the surface.\\nIn the absence of modern methods for direct mind observation, we might\\ntry out some of the tools developed by premodern cultures. Several ancient\\ncultures devoted a lot of attention to the study of mind, and they relied not\\non collecting second-hand reports, but on training people to observe their\\nown minds systematically. The methods they developed are bunched\\ntogether under the generic term ‘meditation’. Today this term is often\\nassociated with religion and mysticism, but in principle meditation is any\\nmethod for direct observation of one’s own mind. Many religions indeed\\nmade extensive use of various meditation techniques, but this doesn’t mean\\nmeditation is necessarily religious. Many religions have also made\\nextensive use of books, yet that doesn’t mean using books is a religious\\npractice.\\nOver the millennia humans have developed hundreds of meditation\\ntechniques, which differ in their principles and effectiveness. I have had\\npersonal experience with only one technique – Vipassana – so it is the only\\none about which I can talk with any authority. Like a number of other\\nmeditation techniques, Vipassana is said to have been discovered in ancient\\nIndia by the Buddha. Over the centuries numerous theories and stories have\\nbeen ascribed to the Buddha, often without any supporting evidence. But\\nyou need not believe any of them in order to meditate. The teacher from\\nwhom I have learned Vipassana, Goenka, was a very practical kind of\\nguide. He repeatedly instructed students that when they observe the mind\\nthey must put aside all second-hand descriptions, religious dogmas and\\nphilosophical conjectures, and focus on their own experience and on\\nwhatever reality they actually encounter. Every day numerous students\\nwould come to his room to seek guidance and ask questions. At the entrance'),\n",

People sometimes turn\\nmeditation into a pursuit of special experiences of bliss and ecstasy. Yet in\\ntruth, consciousness is the greatest mystery in the universe, and mundane\\nfeelings of heat and itching are every bit as mysterious as feelings of rapture\\nor cosmic oneness. Vipassana meditators are cautioned never to embark on\\na search for special experiences, but to concentrate on understanding the\\nreality of their minds whatever this reality might be.\\nIn recent years scholars of both mind and brain have shown increasing\\ninterest in such meditation techniques, but most researchers have so far\\nused this tool only indirectly.2 The typical scientist doesn’t actually practise\\nmeditation herself. Rather, she invites experienced meditators to her\\nlaboratory, covers their heads with electrodes, asks them to meditate, and\\nobserves the resulting brain activities. That can teach us many interesting\\nthings about the brain, but if the aim is to understand the mind, we are\\nmissing some of the most important insights. It’s like someone who tries to\\nunderstand the structure of matter by observing a stone through a\\nmagnifying glass. You come to this person, hand him a microscope, and\\nsay: ‘Try this. You could see much better.’ He takes the microscope, picks\\nup his trusted magnifying glass, and carefully observes through the\\nmagnifying glass the matter from which the microscope is made …\\nMeditation is a tool for observing the mind directly. You miss most of its\\npotential if instead of meditating yourself, you monitor electrical activities\\nin the brain of some other meditator.\\nI am certainly not suggesting abandoning the present tools and practices\\nof brain research. Meditation doesn’t replace them, but it might complement\\nthem. It’s a bit like engineers excavating a tunnel through a huge mountain.\\nWhy dig from only one side? Better dig simultaneously from both. If the\\nbrain and the mind are indeed one and the same, the two tunnels are bound\\nto meet. And if the brain and the mind aren’t the same? Then it is all the\\nmore important to dig into the mind, and not just into the brain.\\nSome universities and laboratories have indeed begun using meditation\\nas a research tool rather than as a mere object for brain studies. Yet this'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'dataa\\\\21 Lessons for the 21st Century by Yuval Noah Harari.pdf'}, page_content='process is still in its infancy, partly because it requires extraordinary\\ninvestment on the part of the researchers. Serious meditation demands a\\ntremendous amount of discipline. If you try to objectively observe your\\nsensations, the first thing you’ll notice is how wild and impatient the mind\\nis. Even if you focus on observing a relatively distinct sensation such as the\\nbreath coming in and out of your nostrils, your mind could usually do it for\\nno more than a few seconds before it loses its focus and starts wandering in\\nthoughts, memories and dreams.\\nWhen a microscope goes out of focus, we just need to turn a small\\nhandle. If the handle is broken, we can call a technician to repair it. But\\nwhen the mind loses focus we cannot repair it so easily. It usually takes a\\nlot of training to calm down and concentrate the mind so it can start\\nobserving itself methodically and objectively. Perhaps in the future we\\ncould pop a pill and achieve instant focus. Yet since meditation aims to\\nexplore the mind rather than just focus it, such a shortcut might prove\\ncounterproductive. The pill may make us very alert and focused, but at the\\nsame time it might also prevent us from exploring the entire spectrum of\\nmind. After all, even today we can easily concentrate the mind by watching\\na good thriller on TV – but the mind is so focused on the movie that it\\ncannot observe its own dynamics.\\nYet even if we cannot rely on such technological gadgets, we shouldn’t\\ngive up. We can be inspired by the anthropologists, zoologist and\\nastronauts. Anthropologists and zoologists spend years on faraway islands,\\nexposed to a plethora of ailments and dangers. Astronauts devote many\\nyears to difficult training regimes, preparing for their hazardous excursions\\nto outer space. If we are willing to make such efforts in order to understand\\nforeign cultures, unknown species and distant planets, it might be worth\\nworking just as hard in order to understand our own minds.
