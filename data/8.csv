Rather, cocaine chewing is a habit among Andeans.",5,"Coca cannot be disassociated with cocaine. The active ingredient in coca leaf is the same as in cocaine. It's just more concentrated in cocaine.

The 28th ECDD report concluded that, ""the coca leaf is appropriately scheduled as a narcotic under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, since cocaine is readily extractable from the leaf.""

In Bolivia, coca eradication efforts in the 1980s and 90s helped reduce cocaine production.
